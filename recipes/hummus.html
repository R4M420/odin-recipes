        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Just so we are all on the same page, let’s talk about what hummus is.
            Hummus is a delicious spread or dip made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon,
            and spices. It’s commonly eaten in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
            Here in the United States, you can find store-bought versions at the grocery
            store, but we think you should skip those and make your own. Let me show you how!</p>
        <p>In the past, if we were in the grocery store you could almost bet that
            one of us would throw a tub of hummus into our cart. That was until we
            figured out this simple hummus recipe that we honestly believe is better
            than anything we could have found at the store. Bonus it’s made with real
            and healthy ingredients, plus it is vegan!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans)</strong> are the base for hummus. 
                The softened beans break down into a smooth paste. You 
                can use canned or home-cooked chickpeas in our recipe.
                I use them interchangeably and give home-cooked chickpeas 
                a slight edge when it comes to the flavor. Here’s my method 
                for cooking dried chickpeas.</li>
            <li><strong>Tahini</strong> is a paste made from ground sesame seeds. 
                It makes the hummus taste incredible. You can buy tahini at the 
                store or you can make it yourself. To make hummus that’s 100% from scratch, 
                we use homemade tahini. It’s easy to make yourself. Here’s our tahini recipe 
                with a video showing how to make it. It lasts up to a month in your refrigerator. 
                Our tahini recipe makes enough tahini for two batches of hummus.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh lemon juice</strong> is important for excellent hummus. Bottled lemon juice does not taste nearly as good.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh garlic</strong> adds a little spice and zest. I add one small clove and find it’s just right. 
                You can also experiment with using roasted garlic for roasted garlic hummus. 
                You can see how we roast garlic here.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground cumin and salt</strong> help to make it taste amazing and the ground cumin adds a little more spice and richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong> makes the texture of the hummus luxurious. 
                We also add a little drizzle to the top of the swirly hummus when we serve it. 
                I really like using fruity, light flavored olive oils when making hummus.</li>  
        </ul>
        <h3>The secret to the smoothest, most luxurious hummus is the order in which you add ingredients to your food processor.</h3>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add <strong>tahini and lemon juice</strong> to your food processor, and then turn it on and <strong>process for a minute</strong> or until they whip up into a creamy paste.</li>
            <li>From here, you can <strong>add ingredients as you will</strong>, but make sure you stand back and 
                let that food <strong>processor</strong> run — we’re talking <strong>a minute of running after adding each ingredient.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cold water</strong> is our last trick for fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus. 
                After all the ingredients are added and we’ve processed into a smooth paste, I love to drizzle in some extra liquid with the processor still running. 
                The liquid (and extra process time) turns the already pretty smooth mixture into a fluffy, luxurious dip!</li>
        </ol>
