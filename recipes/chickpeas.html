            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered what to do with dried chickpeas (or other dried beans)? We used to as well until we learned how to cook them. 
                Now we almost always have a bag of cooked beans in our fridge or freezer. 
                Canned chickpeas or garbanzo beans are readily available and we use them in our kitchen. 
                That said, cooking chickpeas is easy, they taste better and you get to control the texture.</p>
            <h2>Ways to cook dried chickpeas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long soak and simmer on the stovetop</strong>, which takes about 10 hours or overnight plus 2 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Quick soak and simmer on the stove</strong>, which takes about 3 hours</li>
                <li><strong>In the Slow Cooker</strong>, 4 hours on high heat or 8 hours on low heat</li>
                <li><strong>In a pressure cooker</strong> (like an Instant Pot), about 1 hour</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Using the Stove to Cook Garbanzo Beans</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Before cooking on a stovetop, you will need to soak the dried beans.</strong> 
                        Look through the dried beans and pick out anything that doesn’t 
                        look like a bean — sometimes a rock or something else from the bulk aisle sneaks in.</p>
                    <p>Now you can choose which soak method is best for you. As I mentioned above, we use both methods. 
                        It comes down to how much time we have or the time of day.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you have a late start and need the beans tomorrow, use the long soak method and 
                        soak the beans overnight. When you get up in the morning, 
                        you’ll have plump beans ready to cook. If you need the beans cooked asap, the quick soak is best.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For the long soak method</strong>, add the beans to a large bowl and cover them with several inches of water. 
                            As the beans rehydrate, they triple in size — adding plenty of water is key. 
                            Soak the beans for 8 hours or overnight. After soaking the beans, you can cook them (see how below).</li>
                        <li><strong>For the quick soak method</strong>, add the beans to a large pot, cover them with several inches 
                            of water and bring them to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes then take the pot off of the heat and let the beans 
                            sit in the water for 1 hour. After soaking the beans, you can cook them (see how below).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>To cook the soaked beans</strong>, add them to a large pot, cover the beans with several inches of water, and bring everything to a boil. 
                    Reduce the heat and simmer until they reach your desired tenderness, 1 ½ to 2 hours.
                    <p>When simmering, you can keep the pot lid off or on, but slightly ajar (allowing some steam to escape while cooking). 
                        Beans simmered without a lid will be cooked, but firm (perfect for salads or chili).</p>
                    <p><strong>Beans cooked with the lid on, but ajar, will be creamier, softer, and break apart more easily.</strong> 
                        These are perfect for hummus or dishes where you want the beans to break apart.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We love adding a bay leaf and a few garlic cloves. Adding a quarter of an onion, some carrot, or celery is also a great idea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We add a generous pinch of salt when there are about 30 minutes left. 
                    Only add salt towards the end of cooking since adding it in the beginning can cause the beans to become a little tough.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Cooking Chickpeas in the Slow Cooker</h3>
            <p>Another option is to cook them in a slow cooker. The benefit of this is there is no soaking step — everything 
                is added to the slow cooker you turn it on and walk away. Pretty easy.</p>
            <p>Add 1 pound of dried chickpeas and 7 cups of water to a slow cooker. Cook on high for 3 
                to 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours. Note that some of our readers have found this method to make very soft beans, 
                so if you are looking for firmer beans, keep an eye on them towards the end of cooking.</p>
            <h3>Cooking Chickpeas in a Pressure Cooker</h3>
            <p>You can cook soaked and unsoaked chickpeas in a pressure cooker. Here are the details:</p>
            <p><strong>Soaked chickpeas</strong>: Add soaked chickpeas (from 1 pound dried) and 6 cups of water to the pressure cooker. 
                Seal the lid and cook on High Pressure for 12 minutes, and then naturally release for 10 minutes. 
                Vent the remaining pressure before opening the lid (you can tell when it is safe to open the cooker when the steam release valve drops). 
                We recommend you read the user manual of your specific pressure cooker before using it.</p>
            <p><strong>Unsoaked chickpeas (my preferred method)</strong>: Add 1 pound of dried chickpeas and 6 cups of water to the pressure cooker. 
                Seal the lid and cook on High Pressure for 50 minutes, and then naturally release for 10 minutes. 
                Vent the remaining pressure before opening the lid (you can tell when it is safe to open the cooker when the steam release valve drops). 
                We recommend you read the user manual of your specific pressure cooker before using it.</p>
